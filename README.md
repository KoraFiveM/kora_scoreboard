# qb-scoreboard
Scoreboard for QB-Core

Server owners can change display and police-count settings through `/config`.
The default key is an Advanced setting; existing players retain their personal
FiveM key binding. Display capacity changes the scoreboard, not the server's
connection limit. Activity thresholds describe availability; the activity
resource remains responsible for enforcing its own requirements.

Busy/cooldown status is runtime state. Trusted server scripts can use
`TriggerEvent('qb-scoreboard:server:SetActivityBusy', activityId, true)` and
send `false` when it ends. Clients cannot set this state on the server.

Run `bash test/run.sh` for the configuration and interaction smoke checks.
